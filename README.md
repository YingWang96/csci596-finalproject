# csci596-finalproject
## Modification of a C version MPI concurrent wavefunction program "mpi_wave.c" to a hybrid MPI+ OpenMP + CUDA code. This program aims to calculate the amplitude along a uniform, vibrating string after a specified amount of time
- Calculation decomposition
  1. the amplitude on the y axis
